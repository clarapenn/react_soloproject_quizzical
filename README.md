# Quiz game

As part of a React course on the code-learning platform Scrimba, I took on their challenge of making a multiple-choice quiz app. 

Scrimba provided mockups of how things should look, and I built the game to match. It loads in questions and answers from an online quiz database and tots up your score. 

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev  # for dev mode

# or to build a production-ready project
$ npm run build
```
